Test 2

1. Create one or multiple LUN's and verify LUN is created successfully.
-Create one LUN, then through tools or command to check the LUN is added to the system. If not, a reboot maybe required.
-Create multiple LUN, then through tools or command to check the LUN is added to the system. If not, a reboot maybe required.
-Create duplicate name of LUN that name is already existed.
-Create one new same name LUN after remove it.
-Create LUN when no space.

2. Resize(expand) a LUN
-resize the LUN to different size, verify the LUN is resized as expected, check system file or using tool
-expand the LUN to invalid size, check the behavior is expected or not.
-expand the LUN when some application is using it. Verify the behavior.
-verify resize the LUN that the configuration is multipath or storage group of LUN, verify the behavior
-expand the LUN to be higher of limit size, verify the behavior

3. Export a LUN to a host.
-Export a LUN to a host, and verify on this host, the LUN is displayed correctly, and it can be used.
-Export LUN to a host again after the LUN is un-export
-Export LUN to a another host, and make sure the LUN can be used.
-Export multiple LUN to a host

4. Un-export a LUN
-Un-export the LUN when the LUN is in use. Verify on the host, can not see the LUN. 
-Un-export the LUN when the LUN is not used.
-Un-export multiple LUN from host

5. Remove a LUN
-Stop all file access to the LUN to be removed and umount the filesystem if applicable. Remove the LUN, through tool or command to check the LUN to be deleted.
-Remove related paths or id of LUN if need.
-Ensure the LUN is disappeared of output when check the LUN list
-Remove the LUN of multipath or storage group config and verify the behavior
-Remove the LUN when application is using it.
-Remove the LUN that only create and it is not not exported

6. Retrieve the information (size) of a LUN --- how to get LUN's information
-Get the information of LUN using tools or command, verify the name, size or other infor is correct
-After resize LUN, retrieve the information again, and make sure the size is changed.
-Retrieve the information of a LUN that is export status or un-export status

7. Concurrent requests is supported
-Using tool or create small scripts send multiple requests at the same time, verify the behavior. Such as create, remove, export, un-export LUN
-Testing different concurrent requests or according to actual customer's env

8. Performance is not impacted no matter how many LUNâ€™s are created and exported
-Using tools or write a small scripts to create small size LUN, export it for looping x, and check the performance, such as no core, or crash
-On different server, test same operation to get the results, compare the results.
-On same server, using different software or tool to test same function, compare the results
